# Light3r's NixOS configuration ïŒ“
Hello everyone, this is my personal NixOS system configuration. I've switched from Windows 11 in February 2025, so I'm still new to the ecosystem.

ðŸ”´ NOTE: DO NOT deploy this flake directly on your machine, it will not succeed. This flake contains my hardware configuration and other individual information 
(such as hardware-configuration.nix) which are not suitable for your configuration. You're free to use the repo as a reference to build your own configuration.
If you're an experienced user, all suggestions are welcome.

## What's included
The configuration is packed in a flake which contains both NixOS system-level configuration along with user-level (mostly dotfiles) configuration managed through Home Manager
